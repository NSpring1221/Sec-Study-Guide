# 1. Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities
>[!IMPORTANT] Forward
>This is a quick guide for studying and not to be used as a replacement for one's own notes.
## Phishing
* Social Engineering with a touch of spoofing
	* Usually coming from a likely creditable source
	* Often Delivered by Email, text, ETC.
* Usually something is off
* Spelling, Fonts, Graphics

### Tricks and Misdirection
>[!QUESTION]
>How is an attacker successful?

Avenues of attack: 
- Digital sleight of hand
* Typo squatting
* A type of URL hijacking- https://[proffessormessor.com](http://proffessormessor.com/)
	* Misspelling the name to trick people because it can be over read 
* Prepending link - https://[pproffessormesser.com](http://pproffessormesser.com/)
	* adding in another letter somewhere that's easy to overlook
### Pretexting
* Lying to get information
	* Attackers create a unique situation in the hopes of relaxing/tricking you into giving your info the way.
* EXAMPLE: "Hi I am calling from Visa about an automatic payment"

### Pharming
* When an attacker is targeting an entire group of people
* Redirection a legit website to the attacker's website
	* This possible when an attacker is able to take over something like a whole DNS server and be able to redirect a legit site to a bogus one.
* Combining Pharming and Phishing
	* Pharming- to harvest large groups of people
    * Phishing to Collect access credentials
* Difficult for anti-Malware
	* Everything appears legit to the end user, and they are none the wiser.
	
### Vishing (Voice Phishing)
* Done over the phone or voicemail
* Caller ID spoofing is common
* Fake Security checks or bank updates

### Smishing (SMS Phishing)
* Spoofing is the problem here as well
* They forward link or ask for personal information.

### Reconnaissance
* Gather information on the victim

#### Background
* Lead Generations sites
	* Social media
	* Corporate Website

* Attacker builds a believable pretext
	* Where you work
	* Where you bank
	* Recent transactions
	* Family and friends

### Spear Phishing
>[!TLDR] 
>Targeted Attacks against
* Spear Phishing the CEO is called 'Whaling'
	* Targeted Phishing with the possibility of a large catch
	* CEOs, CFOs People with access to a lot of cash flow or corp bank account

## Impersonation
* Before the attack, the trap is set
	* Actor and a story
* Attackers pretend to be someone they are not
* Use some details from Reconnaissance
	* You can trust me, I'm with your help desk
* Attack the victim as someone higher in rank
* Throw in a ton of technical details
* 
### Eliciting Information
>[!TLDR] 
>Hacking the human
- Often seen with Vishing
	* Using psychological strategies

### Identity Fraud
* Your identity can be used by others
* Types of fraud
	* Credit Card
	* Bank
	* Loan
	* Government Benefits
	* Tax
* Protection against Impersonation
	 * Never Volunteer information
	 * Don't disclose personal details
	 * Always verify people before giving info
	 * Verification should be encouraged

## Dumpster Diving
```ad-tldr
Literally Dumpuster Diving for info
```

* Important Information thrown out with the trash
* Dumpster diving is legal (US)
* If it's Trash, it's open season

### Protect your garbage
* Lock it 
* Shred it
* **BURN IT**

## Shoulder Surfing
>[!IMPORTANT]
> People looking at your screen to get the info that you don't want them to have.
* Very Easy to do
	* Airports/Flights
	* Hallway Facing Monitors
	* Coffee Shops
* Surf from afar
	* Binoculars/Telescopes
	* In cities from building to building
	* Webcams
* Control the input
	* Be aware of your surroundings
	* Privacy Filters
* Keep your monitors out of sight
	* away from windows and hallways
## Hoaxes
### Computer Hoaxes
- Yet they seem like they COULD be real
- A Threat that doesn't actually exist
- These consume a lot of resources
	- Looking through emails
	- checking machines
	- a lot of wasted time
- Often an email
	- Social media postings
		- Something looks not quite right
- Hoaxes about a virus can waste as much time as a virus:
>[!EXAMPLE] Examples
>EMAIL: BILL GATES IS SHARING HIS FORTUNE![[Pasted image 20220709131353.png]]
>Mircosoft Errors: ![[Pasted image 20220709131431.png]]

- Ways to fight against it
		- Spam Filters

## Watering Hole Attacks
> [!INFO] Scenario
> - You have a really well-made secure network
> -  Bad guys cannot get in:
> 	- Not Responding to Phishing emails
> 	- Not Opening any email attachments

- So what is an attacker to do? 
	- "Can't make you go to the mountain? They will move the mountain to you"
	- Attacking a provider you visit instead to gain access to you.
- This tactic requires a lot of research:
	- Determine which website the victim group uses
		- educated guesses
			- Coffee Shops
			- Industry related sites
- Infect one of these Third party sits
	- Site Vulnerability
	- Phishing/Emails 
- Infects All Visitors
>[!EXAMPLE] January 2017: Financial Institutions were targeted
- Sites Attacked:
	- Polish Financial Supervision Authority
	- National Banking and Stock Commission of Mexico
	- State-owned bank in Uruguay 
	- The watering hole was sufficiently poisoned
- Visiting the Site would download a JavaScript
	- But only to a specific IP matching banks and other financial institutions
- So Did the attack work?
	- Unknown.

### Defending the Watering Hole
- Defense-in-Depth
	- Layer defenses
	- Never rely on one piece of defense
- Firewall and IPS
	-Stop the network traffic before things get too bad
- Antivirus/Anti-malware signature updates
	- Polish Financial Supervision Authority attach code was identified by Symantec antivirus and stopped.
## Principles of Social Engineering
```ad-info
Social engineering is a low tech form of attack, focusing on gaining information on someone by using social engineering.
```
### Effective Social Engineering
- Constantly Changing
	- Don't know what bad actors will throw at you next
- May Involve multiple People
	- And multiple organizations
- Avenues of attack 
	- Could be in person or electronic
		- Phone calls from aggressive "customers"
		- Emailed funeral notifications of a friend or colleagues
### Principles:
- Authority
	- Pretending they are someone with some level of authority
		- Help Desk
		- Office of the CEO
		- Police
- Intimidation
	- Inciting fear and "what if I don't" to coerce the individual to do something for them.
		- There will be bad things if you don't help
		- If you don't help me, the payroll checks won't be processed
- Consensus/ Social Proof
	- Convince based on what's normally expected
		- "Your co-worker Jill did this for me last week"
- Scarcity
	- The situation will not be this way for long
	- Must make the change before time expires
- Urgency
	- Works alongside scarcity
		- Act quickly, don't think
- Familiarity/Liking
	- Someone you know, we have common friends
- Trust
	- Someone who is safe
		- "I'm from IT, and I am here to help"
```ad-example
Naoki Hisorhima - Twitter handle @N
"How I lost my $50,000 Twitter Username"

- Bad actors called PayPal and used social engineering to get the last four digits of the credit card on file

- Bad guy calls GoDaddy and tells them he lost his card, so he can't properly validate
>	GoDaddy Requires the first two digits of the card as well
>	GoDaddy let the bad guy guess the first two digits untill correct 
Social Engineering down really, really well
- Bad guy is now in control of every domain name
- Bad guy extorts a swap for the twitter @N
- https://medium.com/@N/how-i-lost-my-50-000-twitter-username-24eb09e026dd
```
## Denial of Service
```ad-info
Force a Service to fail/overload a service

```
### Overview of Denial Of Service
- Taking advantage of a design failure or Vulnerability 
	- Keep your systems up to date and patched. 
- Cause a system to be unavailable
	- to Competitive advantage
- Create a smokescreen for some other exploits
	- Precursor to a DNS spoofing attack
- Doesn't have to be complicated
	- Turning off the power to a building.
### A 'friendly' Dos
- Unintentional DoSing
	- It's not always do to bad actor
- Networking DoS
	- Layer 2 loop without Spanning Tree on the switches
- Bandwidth DoS
	- Everyone trying to download a file from the same place at the same time
- Unseen Disasters 
	- Water line breaking destroying everything
### Distributed Denial of Service
- Launch an army of computers to bring down a service
	- Network Traffic spikes
- Botnets
	- Thousands or millions of computers at your command
	- At it's peak, Zeus botnet infected over 3.6 million PCs
	- Coordinated Attack
- Asymmetric threat
	- The single attacker might have fewer resources than the victim but utilizing strength in numbers they can overcome the victims resources.
#### DDoS Amplification
- Turns your small attack into a big attack
	- Often reflected off another device or service
	- 
- Becoming the most common DDoS Technique
	- Turning internet services against the Vitim
- They target protocols with little to no authentications or checks
	- NTP, DNS, ICMP
	- A common protocol abuse
>[!EXAMPLE] DNS DDoS Attack
![[Pasted image 20220709145555.png]]
> Ask for a DNS key that returns a large security key many many times to overload the system:
> ![[Pasted image 20220709145717.png]]

>[!EXAMPLE] Map of DNS amplification DDoS
Start: The Command of the Botnet has a command
![[Pasted image 20220709145929.png]]
Next: The Botnet waits and recieves the command over many many devices
![[Pasted image 20220709150108.png]]
Next: The bot net send a request to DNS servers and spoofs that its from a websever, while requesting the DNS key on all of the resolvers
![[Pasted image 20220709150226.png]]
Final: Since the request was created from the spoof of the webserver all the requests go back to the webserver and not the botnet:
![[Pasted image 20220709150339.png]]


## Man-in-the-Middle
>[!QUESTION] How can a bad actor watch you without you knowing? 
>Man-in-the-Middle
- Redirects your traffic
	- Then they pass it on to the destination
	- You never know your traffic was redirected	
- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)poisoning
	- ARP has no security
>[!EXAMPLE] ARP Poisoning (spoofing)
>To Devices on the same network(Work station on the left and router on the right)
>![[Pasted image 20220709151047.png]]
>Asks for the MAC address of the device with IP 192.168.1.1
>![[Pasted image 20220709151219.png]]
>Response from the router
>![[Pasted image 20220709151312.png]]
>Work station store the MAC address in the ARP Cache. This is done to save time as it will not have to broadcast every time it wants to reach that IP
>![[Pasted image 20220709151350.png]]
>Bad Actor is now on the subnet as well
>![[Pasted image 20220709151510.png]]
>Bad actor sends their own ARP request to the workstation saying that it's the Router IP with the bad actor's MAC Address
>![[Pasted image 20220709151617.png]]
>Work stations saves new information now every time the Work station sends something to the IP it's traffic goes to the bad actor.
>![[Pasted image 20220709151709.png]]
### Man-in-the-browser
>[!QUESTION] What if the middleman was on the same computer as the victim?
- Huge Advantages for the bad guys
	- Calls come from in the browser
	- Malware/Trojan does all the proxy work
	- Relatively easy to proxy encrypted traffic
	- Everything looks normal to the victim
## Buffer Overflows
